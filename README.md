Basic stuff we need to do in general:

1. Add treasure chest algo to the GitHub with the new code.
2. Create an interface for the demo tomorrow.
3. Handle errors with user input
4. Put the comments through Doxygen (GPT)
5. After Assignment 2 create unit tests

For Assignment 2:
1. Character Observer class
2. Integrate Nick's code with Marcus' CSV and input code
3. Interface to create a new map and write to a CSV and vice versa, display files with maps and allow selection of loading in the map.
4. Create algorithm to determine if two maps can fit together; we could have a 2D array of maps.
5. PART 4???
